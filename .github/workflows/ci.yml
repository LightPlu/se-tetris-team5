# Notes:
# - This workflow runs build & tests on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows using Java 21 (Temurin).
# - Gradle cache is configured via setup-java cache and an additional actions/cache step.
# - Windows-native packaging with jpackage is non-trivial on hosted runners; consider self-hosted runner for reproducible EXE creation.
# - To add GitHub Releases publish or code-signing, create a separate 'release' workflow that runs on tags and uses 'actions/create-release' and 'sbc/sign' or other signing actions with secrets.
